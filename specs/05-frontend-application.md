# Specification 05: Frontend Application

[All specifications](README.md)

## Entry point and design system

`src/react-app/main.tsx` mounts React, `I18nProvider` and the Router. Styling uses Tailwind CSS
4, Geist variable font, and neutral shadcn/ui primitives built on Base UI.

Reusable UI includes:

- `AuthCard` and `FormMessage` for auth flows
- `PageContainer` and `PageHeader` for application pages
- Button, Card, Input, Label, and Separator primitives
- Organization and Branch switchers
- Language picker for public, personal and company preferences

The inherited foundation supplied neutral primitives and no product navigation.
ControlWash navigation, interaction, and visual rules extend this module through
[module 18](18-product-frontend-and-design.md). Planned domain screens are not
implementation claims until their verification is recorded.

Source message keys are English; typed catalogs translate UI and email. Reuse Base UI
patterns rather than assuming Radix-specific examples are compatible. Do not
introduce a global state/data-fetching library without a demonstrated need.

## Route groups

### Public/auth layout

Implemented pages:

- `/` — generic home and sign-in/application entry
- `/login` — password sign-in with safe return path
- `/verify-email` — verification resend support
- `/forgot-password` — generic reset request
- `/reset-password` — Better Auth reset completion
- `/setup-account` — authenticated first-time password choice
- `/no-company` — no active company access, including deactivated memberships

Redirects:

- `/register` -> `/login`
- `/onboarding` -> `/app/dashboard`

The unsupported `/accept-invitation` route/page was removed.

### Platform layout

- `/platform` — platform administration home
- `/platform/organizations/new` — customer provisioning form/result

The layout redirects unauthenticated users to login and non-platform users into
the tenant application. Server endpoints repeat the authoritative guard.

### Application layout

- `/app/dashboard` — active company and Branch summary
- `/app/branches` — current Branch management implementation
- `/app/no-branch-access` — zero-assignment member/limited-admin state
- `/app/members` — directory, provisioning, access/delegation editing, deactivation/reactivation and setup resend
- `/app/settings` — workspace summary, personal language and guarded company language

## Application shell state

`AppLayout` composes:

- Better Auth session
- active company memberships from `/api/companies` via `useCompanies()`
- active Organization and active Organization member role
- effective all-Branch, admin-appointment and Branch-creation permissions
- accessible Branches from `/api/branches`
- active accessible Branch
- Organization/Branch switching
- sign-out

It exposes typed `AppShellContext` to nested routes through React Router outlet
context. Dashboard, Branch and Member pages consume that shared state instead of issuing
duplicate Branch requests.

`useBranches()` distinguishes:

- not loaded for the current Organization
- successful Branch list
- successful empty list
- request failure

Loaded state is keyed by Organization ID so a previous tenant's Branches are not
reported after switching. Branch data and role are revalidated on focus/visibility
and every 30 seconds while visible. A failed fetch is never treated as empty
access; recovery failure exposes a retry instead of an endless spinner.

`useCompanies()` is session-user-keyed and abortable, with the same focus,
visibility and visible 30-second refresh. Inactive companies disappear from
selection; server checks deny their access immediately on the next request,
independently of UI refresh timing. Already rendered content is not erased remotely.

Small frontend libraries also provide class-name composition, safe auth error
mapping, return-path validation, and slug utilities. The frontend slug utility
is legacy from the removed self-service onboarding direction and has no current
route consumer; Organization slug creation is authoritative in the Worker.

## Switching behavior

`OrganizationSwitcher` consumes the shell's active-only company list, not a
second request to Better Auth's unrestricted Organization directory. One company
is a plain label. A valid active company is kept; otherwise one available company
is activated automatically, several show an explicit chooser inside the app
layout, and none shows `/no-company`. The chooser preserves the intended app path.

`activateCompany()` uses the guarded `/api/companies/active` endpoint. The server
clears the old active Team; the UI reloads after success to discard company A's
session, Branches and forms before rendering company B. Failure shows retry, not
an arbitrary company fallback.

`activateBranch()` first calls Better Auth `setActiveTeam()`. If Better Auth
requires a missing Team-member row for an Owner/unrestricted admin, it adds that row through
the supported API and retries. Backend Branch authorization remains role-aware.

## Member form lifecycle

`MembersPage` owns a company/role/scope-keyed workspace with abortable directory
loads, add/edit forms, resend/status state and accessible feedback. `MemberForm`
shares role and Branch controls, offers admins all/selected scope where allowed,
and exposes the appointment checkbox only to the Owner. The admin role option
requires appointment authority. A status confirmation names the person and says
that deactivation affects only this company; reactivation restores saved access.
Inactive members cannot resend setup. Shared out-of-scope employees are explicitly
read-only. The form never asks an administrator
to choose a user's password. The server-returned `canManage` flag controls edit
visibility; server policy is authoritative. See [Member Management](07-member-management.md).

Settings beyond language and invitation acceptance remain deliberate exclusions.

## Localization contract

The platform-neutral `src/shared/i18n/` module contains a registry, English source
message keys, complete typed catalogs, resolution and Intl formatting helpers.
English and Spanish are the initial catalogs, not a two-language limit. Each new
catalog implements `Catalog`; registering its native name, Intl locale and
direction enables it in every selector and server validator. Do not add a second
language list or per-feature language conditionals.

Authenticated priority is personal `user.locale` → validated active Organization
locale → `DEFAULT_LOCALE` (English). Null means Automatic/inherit. Unsupported
legacy values safely fall back; registered regional/script codes are matched
case-insensitively on reads, with parent fallback. Writes require an exact
registered key or null. Currency and timezone are independent, not inferred.

Public pages resolve supported URL `lang` → saved browser choice → browser
language list → application fallback. The public choice uses only
`app.public-language` in localStorage and still works in memory if storage is
unavailable. It is not a tenant identifier or account preference. Signing in
does not silently persist it. Account-setup callbacks may use an explicit `lang`
hint while authenticated but not yet inside a company; personal/company values
still take priority and that hint never selects a company.

`I18nProvider` reads `/api/account/locale` and keys each response by user and
active Organization. It aborts stale requests and uses generation checks so a
late response cannot replace the new context. Initial authenticated loading and
failure are distinct states with retry/sign-out; no old company's language is
rendered while resolving the next. Preferences refresh on focus/visibility and
every 30 seconds while visible. Successful saves update the matching context
immediately and revalidate it.

The language API contract is intentionally narrow:

- `GET /api/account/locale` returns `{userLocale,organization}`. The optional
  Organization value contains only `{id,locale,canEdit}` after current active
  membership validation.
- `PATCH /api/account/locale` accepts exactly `{locale}` and changes only the
  authenticated user. `PATCH /api/company/locale` accepts the same body and
  changes only the active company after an Owner/admin guard.
- A write value is one exact registered locale key or `null`; extra fields and
  unsupported values fail safely. `src/worker/localization.ts` owns this
  validation and persistence. The browser never submits a user or company ID as
  language authority.

Company saves send `X-Company-Context` as a concurrency precondition. If another
tab changed the session's active company, the Worker returns `409 WORKSPACE_CHANGED`
instead of applying the old form to the new company. The header grants no access;
the active session and live membership remain the authority. The current browser
always sends the header; the backend accepts its absence for non-browser callers
but never derives a tenant from it.

`useT()` renders labels, navigation, descriptions, errors and confirmations.
State stores typed message keys rather than translated strings; changing language
updates existing feedback and preserves mounted form inputs. Named placeholders
translate complete sentences without translating names or interpreting inserted
content. React escapes text; email has its own HTML escaping. Document title,
`html.lang` and `html.dir` follow the resolved language. Native browser validation
and password-manager UI use the browser's own language.

`LanguagePicker` is visible in public/platform/application shells and Settings.
After login it saves only the current person's preference. Settings also exposes
the active company's language, editable only by its Owner/admin (including
branch-scoped admins); ordinary members see a disabled selector and explanation.
This is a language permission, not additional Branch/data access. Timezone,
currency and other product settings remain uneditable.

Adding another language needs a complete catalog, one registry entry, checks
and visual/email review. RTL and plural-rich domain features need their own
appropriate layout/formatting work. There is no runtime machine translation.

## Acceptance checks

- Navigation exposes platform/tenant management only to the corresponding role;
  typing a management URL as an ordinary member does not bypass the UX guard.
- Switching companies discards old forms, feedback and late directory responses.
- A failed request shows an error/retry, not a successful empty list or an
  indefinite loading state.
- One accessible Branch is a label; multiple Branches offer a usable selector.
- One active company is a label; several require a choice only when no valid
  company is active. Revoked membership cannot remain a selectable company.
- Scoped admins see only authorized Branches, no create-Branch form, and no
  controls for granting wider scope or onward appointment delegation.
- Auth, switchers and management forms support keyboard input, visible focus,
  semantic labels, password managers and accessible pending/error feedback.
- Mobile/reflow layouts and browser zoom remain usable; never disable pinch
  zoom. See [recorded browser checks](VERIFICATION.md#browser-review) for what was
  actually exercised, rather than treating this checklist as a test log.
- Dashboard and Settings display current workspace data. Settings edits only
  personal/company language; the unsupported invitation page is not advertised.
- Public selection, company inheritance, personal override, clearing an override
  and company switching keep the correct language through reload/sign-in.
- UI copy, existing feedback, role labels and accessible names are translated;
  company/member/Branch data stays unchanged. New catalogs have complete keys
  and matching placeholders. Late requests cannot restore old preferences.
